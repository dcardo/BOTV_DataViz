BOTV_DataViz: Visualizing BIM Coordination
==========================================

This project is about interactively collecting and visualizing large amounts of BIM coordination data. It is part of my doctoral research on computer-aided design and building information modeling (its title is "Builders of the vision, hence BOTV"). This repository is meant to help me keep track of the project as I develop it. 

Languages:

- Processing, v. 1.5.1. Currently being updated to the latest version (2.0b8).
- I plan to upload the data collection module, which was written in Microsoft VisualBasic.
